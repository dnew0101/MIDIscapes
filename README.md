# MIDIscapes
A solo project I thought of creating, due to the struggle of not being able to take your home studio DAW with you when you need it the most!

The features will be simple, but robust:
THE ESSENTIALS;
- MIDI recording and playback, with the audio representation of a few instruments.
- The MIDI representations in this program should correspond to their DAW counterparts (when MIDI is downloaded from the site and uploaded to a DAW, the transition should be seamless and require no extra editing to the MIDI file itself).
- Recording MIDI in real-time with a MIDI controller or computer keyboard.
- After recording MIDI, there will be two distinct download options; download one specific track of MIDI, or download all MIDI tracks at once.

EXTRA, POTENTIAL FEATURES;
- As a tool for pragmatic responsive design idea (and to enable any potential and convenient use on mobile devices), the UI on mobile devices will primarily be a piano roll that responds to touch for real-time recording. For drums, a simple drum pad would suffice for the majority of drum MIDI needs.
- On the web app/desktop UI, adding the flair of 3D instruments to represent the instruments being utilized during playback and recording.
- Both the mobile app and web app should both have "memory" features, whereby a recent project is stored locally in a user's browser (this enhances the overall user experience by allowing for quick entry into the program, without the hassle of logging in and out for a simple MIDI creation).
- And more...
